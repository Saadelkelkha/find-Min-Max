# find-Min-Max
This script defines two arrow functions, `min` and `max`, which respectively find the smaller and larger of two given numbers. It then prompts the user twice to enter numbers, ensuring valid inputs using a while loop and `isNaN`. Finally, it displays the smallest and largest values entered by the user using `document.write`.
